\title{Bootstrapped Network Generalization Plots}
\usage{
bootgenPlot(object, bootmat = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An output from the \emph{bootgen} function}

\item{bootmat}{Should the bootstrap generalization matrix be included?
Defaults to FALSE.
Set to TRUE to plot the original and bootmat networks' reliablities}
}
\value{
Returns the following plots:
a reliability matrix for the original network
("Original Network Correlation Reliabilities"
upper triangle = network reliabilites from the filtered network,
lower triangle = full, unfiltered matrix reliablities),
a plot of retained correlations on their reliability ("Original Network Correlation Strength on Reliability"),
a reliability matrix for the bootgen network
("bootgen Network Correlation Reliabilities"
upper triangle = network reliabilites from the bootgen filtered network,
lower triangle = full, unfiltered matrix reliablities),
a plot of retained correlations on their reliability ("Original Network Correlation Strength on Reliability")
}
\description{
Bootstraps the sample to identify the most stable correlations (still in testing)
