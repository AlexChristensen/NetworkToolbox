\title{Bootstrapped Network Generalization Plots}
\usage{
bootgenPlot(object, bootmat = FALSE, breaks = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An output from the \emph{bootgen} function}

\item{bootmat}{Should the bootstrap generalization matrix be included?
Defaults to FALSE.
Set to TRUE to plot the original and bootmat networks' reliablities}

\item{breaks}{If bootmat = TRUE, then reliability comparison histogram is produced.
The breaks may not appear as desired, so the researcher can adjust as needed.
Defaults to 20 (try 10 if 20 isn't equivalent breaks)}
}
\value{
Returns the following plots:
a reliability matrix for the original network
("Original Network Correlation Reliabilities"
upper triangle = network reliabilites from the filtered network,
lower triangle = full, unfiltered matrix reliablities),
a plot of retained correlations on their reliability ("Original Network Correlation Strength on Reliability"),
If bootmat is set to TRUE, then also 
a reliability matrix for the bootgen network
("bootgen Network Correlation Reliabilities"
upper triangle = network reliabilites from the bootgen filtered network,
lower triangle = full, unfiltered matrix reliablities),
a plot of retained correlations on their reliability ("bootgen Network Correlation Strength on Reliability"),
a frequency of the reliability of edges in both the original and bootgen network
