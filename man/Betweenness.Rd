\title{Betwenness Centrality}
\usage{
Betweenness(A = A, weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{An adjacency matrix of network data.}

\item{weighted}{Is the network weighted? Defaults to TRUE. Set to FALSE for unweighted measure of betwenness centrality.}
}
\value{
A vector of betweenness centrality values for each node in the network.
}
\description{
Computes betweenness centrlaity of each node in a network (Weighted not coded).
}
\examples{
weighted_BC<-Betweenness(A)
unweighted_BC<-Betweenness(A,weighted=FALSE)
