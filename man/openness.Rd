\title{Four Inventories of Openness to Experience}
\format{
A 794 x 138 response matrix (openness) and 138 x 7 matrix (openness.key).
Here are detailed descriptions of the key:

\itemize{

\item{\code{Inventory}}
{The personality inventory the item belongs to}

\item{\code{Facet}}
{The personality inventory defined facet}

\item{\code{JPA.Domains}}
{The broad domains identified by Christensen, Cotter, and Silvia (2019)}

\item{\code{JPA.Facets}}
{The facets identified by Christensen, Cotter, and Silvia (2019)}

\item{\code{Item.Label}}
{The labels used in Christensen, Cotter, and Silvia (2019)}

\item{\code{Item.Description}}
{Descriptions of each item. Note that the NEO-PI-3 items are protected by 
copyright and therefore have been paraphrased. These item descriptions
do not represent the item as given to the participant}

\item{\code{Reversed}}
{Whether an item should be reversed or not (\code{openness} is already reversed)}

}
}
\usage{
data(openness)

data(openness.key)
}
\description{
A response matrix (\emph{n} = 794) of all four Openness to Experience
inventories from Christensen, Cotter, & Silvia (2019). The
key provides inventory, facet, and item description information
for the item labels. Note that because of NEO's copyrights the
items have been shortened and paraphrased
