\title{Participation Coefficient}
\usage{
partcoef(A, factors = c("walktrap", "louvain"))
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Network adjacency matrix}

\item{factors}{A vector of corresponding to each item's factor.
Defaults to "walktrap" for the walktrap community detection algorithm.
Set to "louvain" for the louvain community detection algorithm.
Can also be set to user-specified factors (see examples)}
}
\value{
Returns a list of overall (signs not considered; overall),
negative (negative), and positive (positive) participation coefficient
}
\description{
Computes the participation coefficient for each node. The participation
coefficient measures the strength of a node's connections within its community. Positive
and negative signed weights for participation coefficients are computed separately.

#theoretical factors
factors <- c(rep(1,8), rep(2,8), rep(3,8),
+ rep(4,8), rep(5,8), rep(6,8))

A <- TMFG(neoOpen)$A

pc <- partcoef(A, factors = factors)

#walktrap factors
wpc <- partcoef(A, factors = "walktrap")
