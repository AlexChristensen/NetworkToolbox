#' NetworkToolbox--package
#' @description Implements network analysis and graph theory measures used
#' in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology.
#' Methods include various filtering methods and approaches such as
#' threshold, dependency, Information Filtering Networks, and Efficiency-Cost Optimization.
#' Brain methods include the recently developed Connectome Predictive Modeling.
#' Also implements several network measures including local network characteristics
#' (e.g., centrality), global network characteristics (e.g., clustering coefficient),
#' and various other measures associated with the reliability and
#' reproducibility of network analysis.
