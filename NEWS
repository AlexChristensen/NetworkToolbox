o new data files: NEO-PI-3 data for psychometric network analysis, verbal fluency files for semantic network analysis, behavioral NEO-PI-3 and an associated brain connectivity array for brain network analysis

o bootgen: no longer produces plots; added is.graphical function to automatically check if network is graphical when method = "LoGo"

o bootgenPlot: output from the bootgen function can now be input into a separate function to obtain plots. Contains an argument to also plot the bootstrapped network generalization method
